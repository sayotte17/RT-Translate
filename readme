Below is a combined README example that incorporates all the suggested sections. Feel free to customize any of the details (like port number, library versions, or license) to reflect your actual project setup.

# Chicken Translate

Chicken Translate is a multilingual translator web application that integrates speech-to-text (via OpenAI Whisper) and text-to-text translation (via DeepL). Its goal is to break language barriers by providing an easy-to-use interface for both typed and voice-based translations.

## Features

- **Instant Translations**: Quickly translate between a variety of languages.  
- **Speech-to-Text Integration**: Convert voice input into text automatically using Whisper.  
- **Multiple Target Languages**: Translate into multiple languages in a single request.  
- **Real-Time Stats**: Track total translations processed and total words translated, displayed on the About page.

├─ Backend/
│  ├─ app.py            # Main Flask application
│  ├─ db.json           # JSON file storing persistent stats

- **`Backend/app.py`**: Contains Flask routes for home, translator, and about pages, plus API endpoints for translation and speech-to-text.  
- **`Backend/db.json`**: A simple JSON-based datastore for tracking stats (e.g., translations processed, words translated).  
- **`Frontend/templates/`**: HTML files for the UI (Home, Translator, About).

## Requirements & Installation

1. **Python 3.9+** (recommended)
2. **Pip Packages**:  
   - `deepl` (for text translation)  
   - `openai-whisper` or `whisper` (for speech-to-text)  
   - `flask` (web framework)  
   - `requests`, `json`, etc.

   You can install them via:  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

	3.	FFmpeg:
	•	Required by Whisper to decode audio on the server.
	•	macOS: brew install ffmpeg
	•	Ubuntu/Debian: sudo apt-get install ffmpeg
	•	Windows: Download from ffmpeg.org and add to your PATH.

Running the Application
	1.	Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/RT-Translate.git
cd RT-Translate


	2.	Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt


	3.	Run the Flask server:

python Backend/app.py


	4.	Open your browser and visit:

http://127.0.0.1:3000

(or whatever port is configured in app.py).

	5.	Ensure you have a DeepL API key if needed. This can be hardcoded or placed in an environment variable, depending on your setup.

Usage
	1.	Home Page – Provides an introduction and links to the Translator and About pages.
	2.	Translator Page:
	•	Source Language: Choose from the dropdown.
	•	Target Languages: Select one or multiple languages.
	•	Mic Button: Click to start recording speech, click again to stop. The audio is sent to the server, transcribed, and then translated.
	•	Translate Button: For typed text, click “Translate” after choosing the source/target languages.
	3.	About Page – Learn about the project’s mission, see real-time stats on Translations Processed and Words Translated.

Stats Tracking
	•	db.json stores:
	•	translations_processed: the number of translations completed
	•	words_translated: a running total of words translated
	•	Each time a text or voice translation is processed, the server increments these stats. The About page then displays them.
